# ‚úÖ React To-Do List App
A simple To-Do List application built with React. You can add tasks, delete them, and mark tasks as done. When a task is marked as Done, it will get an overline (visual indicator of completion), move to the bottom of the list, and can be reverted back with Undo.

## Features
‚ûï Add new tasks  
‚ùå Delete existing tasks  
‚úÖ Mark tasks as Done / Undo  
üìå Completed tasks are shown with an overline and moved to the bottom  

## Tech Stack
Frontend: React (useState hooks)  
Language: JavaScript (ES6+)  
Styling: Inline styles + basic CSS classes
